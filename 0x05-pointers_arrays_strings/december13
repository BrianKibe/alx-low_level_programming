this is sort of a to-do list
I have been procrastinating a lot, especially on an article that I was supposed to have done over a month ago

I want to finish it today and send it

Hopefully I will be paid before January 2024

they pay $200 

I also want to write a  few more and reach out to a bunch of editors

I need a thousand dollars each month in the year 2024

I also need to cut an EP and put it out, the title is cornucopia - it will be successful and I'll get a record deal and
get started with an incredibly successful music career

I will do all this
